      <h2>About me</h2>
      <h3>SPORTS</h3>
        <p>My two favorite sports are running and basketball. I have ran for most of my life, starting with track and field at the<br />
        age of 5. My friends call me crazy for loveing to run but I find it crazy they don't fell the same way. In highschool,<br />
        I did cross country my freshman year, and track all four years. Starting in 7th grade, I joined a group called<br />
        Students Run LA (SRLA), and have ran the LA Marathon 5 times. I joined the Basketball team my sophmore year and worked my<br />
        way to JV captain. Junior year I got moved up to Varsity and was still made captain. Junior year, for the first time in<br />
        Canoga Park High School history our boys Basketball team won the City Championship! This year I am the head captain and we<br />
        are looking to win back to back titles.</p>
      <h3>BAND</h3>
        <p>Band has been one of my favorite experiences of my high school career. I've played the trumpet for eight years now.<br />
        When I first join the Canoga Band we had around 16 to 18 people. Over the years our program has grown and we now stand<br />
        at a strong 40. I played Trumpet freshman through junior year and this year I am the Drum Major. My sophmore year,<br />
        I had the opportunity to be a part of the LAUSD ALL-City Marching Band. We march several parades including the Rose Parade.<br />
        Near the end of our season I received and honorable mention for my hard work. I joined the All-City band the following year<br />
        and was awarded the 2017-2018 Marching King. This upcoming season I am trying out for Drum Major of the All-City Marching Band.</p>
      <h3>SCHOOL</h3>
        <p>Right now my favorite class is physics. I love problem solving and that is one of the main reasons I am persuing the STEM<br />
        field and engineering. At this time I lean more toward Mechanical Engineering but still want to explore my options and see<br />
        what the other fields are like.</p>

      <h3>FAVORITE PROJECT</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Robot Ninja Warrior</li>
        	<p>This was my favorite competition because the way that I won  just made all of us laugh. The objective was to see who could<br />
          get the farthest on the obstacle course. My robot made it to about the same spot as the others but then I threw foward this<br />
          long arm because in the rules it was stated farthest contact point wins.</p>
